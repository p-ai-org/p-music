# p-music
A public repository for the p-music P-ai project for the Fall 2022 semester. This repository contains all the code used during the exploratory sessions, data, models trained, and results!

Welcome to P-Music!!

This repository just includes some of the initial exploration for the P-Music project directed by P-ai, the goal of this 
project is to train a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) in order to learn how to rate albums numerically. We will be able to
give an album as input, and output a numerical star rating for the album. Hopefully, we will also be able to work with GPT3 to
unlock some really cool autogenerated text ratings for each of these albums, linked below is a whole list of resources which
we will be using for the initial exploration....
